## Working:
>- This is an react application ,which is fetching data from API ("https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1") and showing the data on the grid format with the help of bootstrap framework.
>
>- I have used  bit of css to give color to the application.

## Method:
>- I have used fetchPosts function to get the api data and using map function display the data as per the need.
>-  I have also used setTimeout() method  which calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.  
>-  In side the fetchPosts function i have used fetch() method to call the the API.
>-  Used material ui which is a  an open-source project that features React components that implement Google's Material Design.
>-  Using material ui i have added loading(loader) feature 


## How to use it:

>- Click on the Get User Button which is located in the navbar at right corner.
>- When you click the button it shows the loading feature which i have added using material ui and after 2 sec it fetch the data from API and shows on the page using grid pattern.
